# Bike Servicing Management API

A robust backend API built using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **TypeScript**, **Prisma ORM**, and **PostgreSQL**. This API enables a bike servicing center to efficiently manage customers, bikes, and service records. It supports comprehensive CRUD operations for all entities and includes specialized endpoints for assigning and completing servicing jobs.

## üìã Features

- **Customer Management**: Create, read, update, and delete customer details securely.
- **Bike Management**: Fully manage bike records with proper customer association.
- **Service Record Management**: Track service jobs from creation to completion.
- **Relationship Management**: Maintain proper relations between customers, bikes, and services.
- **Service Status Tracking**: Monitor pending, in-progress, and completed services.
- **Overdue Services Detection**: Identify services that are pending for more than 7 days.
- **TypeScript Integration**: Type annotations for reliability and maintainability.
- **Prisma ORM**: Modern database toolkit for PostgreSQL interaction with type safety.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with standardized response structures.
- **UUID Implementation**: Secure unique identifiers for all database entities.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (>=14.x.x)
- **Bun** (latest version)
- **PostgreSQL**
- **Git**
- **TypeScript** (Optional: If you prefer to install globally)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ayan-akd/b4-a8-bike-servicing.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd b4-a8-bike-servicing
   bun install
   ```

3. Create a .env file in the root directory with your PostgreSQL connection details:
   ```bash
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/bike_servicing_db"
   PORT=5000
   NODE_ENV=development
   ```

4. Run Prisma migrations to set up your database schema:
   ```bash
   bun migrate
   ```

5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   bun dev
   ```

The server will run at http://localhost:5000 (or another port if you configure it differently).

## üõ†Ô∏è Scripts

The project includes several npm scripts for development and production:

- `bun postinstall`:  Automatically generates Prisma client after installation.
- `bun migrate`: Runs Prisma migrations to update the database schema.
- `bun build`: Builds the production application using TypeScript compiler.
- `bun dev`: Starts the application in development mode with live reloading using tsx.
- `bun prod`: Runs the application in production mode..
- `bun lint`: Lints the codebase using **ESLint**.
- `bun lint:fix`: Automatically fixes linting errors.

## API Endpoints

- **GET /api/customers/:id** - Get a specific customer by ID
- **PUT /api/customers/:id** - Update customer details
- **DELETE /api/customers/:id** - Delete a customer

### Bike Management

- **POST /api/bikes** - Add a new bike
- **GET /api/bikes** - Get all bikes
- **GET /api/bikes/:id** - Get a specific bike by ID
- **PUT /api/bikes/:id** - Update bike details
- **DELETE /api/bikes/:id** - Delete a bike

### Service Management

- **POST /api/services** - Create a service record
- **GET /api/services** - Get all service records
- **GET /api/services/:id** - Get a specific service record
- **PUT /api/services/:id/complete** - Mark a service as completed
- **GET /api/services/status** - Get pending or overdue services (older than 7 days)

## Database Schema

The API uses Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL and implements the following schema:

### Customer
| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `customerId` | UUID | Unique identifier for the customer |
| `name` | String | Full name of the customer |
| `email` | String | Unique email |
| `phone` | String | Contact number |
| `createdAt` | DateTime | Auto timestamp when created |

### Bike
| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `bikeId` | UUID | Unique identifier for each bike |
| `brand` | String | Brand of the bike (e.g., Honda, Yamaha) |
| `model` | String | Model name |
| `year` | Int | Manufacturing year |
| `customerId` | UUID | Foreign key referencing Customer |

### ServiceRecord
| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `serviceId` | UUID | Unique identifier for the service record |
| `bikeId` | UUID | FK to Bike |
| `serviceDate` | DateTime | Date the service started |
| `completionDate` | DateTime | Nullable. Date the service completed |
| `description` | String | Details of service (e.g., oil change) |
| `status` | String | Status: "pending", "in-progress", "done" |

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building the server.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js for building the API.
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe JavaScript for a more reliable and maintainable codebase.
- **Prisma ORM**: Next-generation ORM for Node.js and TypeScript.
- **PostgreSQL**: Powerful open-source relational database system.
- **Bun**: JavaScript runtime & toolkit designed as a drop-in replacement for Node.js.
- **tsx**: TypeScript execution and module system, used for running TypeScript files with live reloading.
- **ESLint**: Linting tool to enforce consistent coding styles.
- **Prettier**: Code formatter to maintain consistent formatting across the codebase.
- **http-status**: Utility for HTTP status codes.

## Error Handling

The API implements standardized error responses with the following structure:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "status": 404,
  "message": "Customer not found",
  "stack": "Optional stack trace shown only in development"
}
```
